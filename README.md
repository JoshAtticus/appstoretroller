# AppStoreTroller

Very simple tweak to let you purchase an app to your Apple ID that requires a newer iOS version than the one you're running on your device. Afterwards, you can install the last compatible version onto your device, if it exists.

Works with iOS 14.2 and later, libhooker & substrate support
